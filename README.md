# LatestKernelRPI
The latest Linux kernel (not RPF), built for the Raspberry Pi.

This is the latest Linux kernel (currently 5.9.1) built for the Raspberry Pi. It is not the official RPF kernel, but rather a stock Linux kernel built for working with the Pi. It may be buggy, and is not currently recommended as a daily driver.

This also has a script that you can use to build the latest stock kernel for the Pi.
